/* Struct for passing in RGB settings for LED1 and LED2
 *
 * This is a common practice in C, where we want to be able to group
 * logically related data together and control how its binary representation
 * will look. Here, we pack three 8-bit values into 32 bits and name them
 * so we can manipulate them, see test_part2.c.Each 8-bit value is an
 * unsigned int, and c defines standard types for us.
 *
 * "uint8_t" stands for: Unsigned INT, 8-bit wide, Type so uint8_t.
 *
 * The lowest order byte is blue, then red, then green. The filler
 * variable ensures the struct lines up to a 32-bit boundary.
 *
 * This means we can pass in a single argument of type gbr32_t as
 * a function argument and it will fit neatly into R0 with the bits
 * we need to output in the correct order.
 *
 * Note the order of the colors to correspond to the layout of the
 * WS2812 communication protocol.
